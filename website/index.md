## Prerequisites
While you do not need to know any python or programming languages to attend this workshop, you will need to have the following prerequisites met before attending.

### Internet Browser
You will also need to be able to access the internet through relatively up-to-date browser such as Chrome, Safari or Firefox.

### GitHub Account
GitHub allows you to host static pages such as this one you are viewing right now, store project code and collaborate with project team members. If you do not currently have a GitHub user account, please [register here](https://github.com/) before the workshop begins. Please make sure you remember you username and password.

### HackMD
HackMD uses a markdown language and provides a collaborative workspace for note-taking. We will use it during the workshop to get started, introduce ourselves and for communication of notes as well as Q&A. [Create an account](https://hackmd.io/) to be ready to share your insight during the workshop. You will receive a link to our workshop's HackMD page at the beginning of the workshop.

## Technology used in creating workshop
Below is a list of the all the technology/software I used in creating workshop materials, but is not necessary to have in order to participate in the workshop. However, if you plan to attend other workshops that require the same tools, you shoud consider installing them now and reaching out to a Resbaz facilitor, helper or instructor if you need help with installation. If you are not sure how much you will use these tools, I would recommend attending the workshop with only prequisites (listed above) and see what you may think will be useful for you in the future. There are weekly Resbaz events on campus (virtual until further notice with COVID-19) called "Coffee and Code" and "Hacky Hour" where you can find support anytime of the year.

### Bash Shell 
Allows you to interface with your computer and do lots of cool stuff. Consider attending _Automate the boring parts using Unix Shell_ led by Sateesh Peri.

Select your operating system:
- **Windows:** Download [Git for Windows installer](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- **MacOS:** The default shell in all versions of macOS is Bash, so no need to install anything. You access Bash from the Terminal (found in `/Applications/Utilities`). 
- **Linux:** The default shell is usually Bash, but if your machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a terminal and typing bash. There is no need to install anything.

### Anaconda
Anaconda gives you access to open source software where you can utilize Python to begin your programming projects. The Jupyter Notebooks that we will be working with were created using Anaconda. [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) It is an all-in-one installer and I would recommend installing a version with Python 3.6 or higher.

Check out other Python-based workshops during Resbaz 2020:
- _Intro to Python II_ led by Drake Asberry
- _Test-Driven Development with PyTest_ led by Ken Youens-Clark
- _Intro to Machine Learning (Python, UA HPC, and Containers)_ led by Dima Shyshlov and Chris Reidy
- _Using Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio on the UA HPC_ led by Blake Joyce
- _Data Wrangling and Plotting in Python: it's actually half R_ led by Blake Joyce
- _Scraping Twitter with Python_ led by Darla Still

### Git
Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your code on GitHub. Consider attending _Better version control with Git_ workshop led by Laurel Thomson.

Select your operating system:
- **Windows:** Git should have been installed on your computer when you installed Bash Shell
- **MacOS:** For OS X 10.9 and higher, [install Git for Mac](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/) by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer. For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8) use the most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard" available. After installing Git, there will not be anything in your `/Applications` folder, as Git is a command line program. 
- **Linux:** If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install git` and for Fedora run `sudo dnf install git`.

### Text Editor
Text editors are nice to have when writing code especially those that support syntax highlighting. Many text editors exist such Vim, Notepad++, Sublime, Atom, etc. If you already currently have a preferred choice of text editor, I would suggest you stick with it. However if not, please follow the directions below to install Nano.

Select your operating system:
- **Windows:** It is installed along with Git when you installed Bash.
- **MacOS:** It is installed along with Git.
- **Linux:** It is installed along with Git.
